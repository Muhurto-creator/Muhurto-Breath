## The Vibe: Effortless Tranquility

Muhurto is more than a tool; it's a digital sanctuary. In a world of constant notifications and distractions, this app provides a quiet corner on the web to reconnect with the simple, powerful act of breathing. Every design choice, animation, and feature is crafted to be calm, intuitive, and unobtrusive.

Our core philosophy is minimalism. We use pure, vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fast, accessible, and focused experience, free from the weight of heavy frameworks.
